    <h1>Rome, Italy</h1>

    <p>
        Rome is the capital of Italy and is often called the "Eternal City."
        It was the heart of the Roman Empire and today it remains a place where
        history, art, and modern life come together.
    </p>

    <p>
        Among its wonders are the Colosseum, the Trevi Fountain, and the Vatican.
        Walking through Rome feels like traveling back in timeâ€”every corner is filled
        with centuries of culture and tradition.
